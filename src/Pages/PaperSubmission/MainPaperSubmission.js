              <strong>Who needs a visa to enter Canada?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Obtaining a Visa to enter Canada is the responsibility of the
              participants. We can assist you by issuing an invitation letter,
              however, we are not involved in the visa issuing process, this is
              solely the responsibility of the competent Canadian embassy or
              consulate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Invitation letters will be issued for registered participants who
              fully paid the ICEBM 2023 registration fees. You/your spouse must
              be registered participant/s to be considered for an invitation
              letter.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid any delays, we encourage all those who need a visa to
              enter Canada, to register as early as possible and apply for the
              visa.
            </p>
